<center><h1><b>Pastel Mix</b></h1></center>
 <p align="center">Welcome to Pastel Mix - a mixed latent diffusion model. This model is intended to produce high-quality, highly detailed anime style with just a few prompts.</p>

   <p align="center">This model is made with the thought of imitating pastel-like art and the potential of mixing LORAs into a model altogether to create a fantastic mix. 
   Recipe for this mix could be found below. Like other anime-style Stable Diffusion models, it also supports danbooru tags to generate images. </p>

<p align="center">e.g. <b>masterpiece, best quality, upper body, 1girl, looking at viewer, red hair, medium hair, purple eyes, demon horns, black coat, indoors, dimly lit</b></p>
